The Chinese MNIST dataset uses data collected in the frame of a project at Newcastle University.

Project Description
One hundred Chinese nationals took part in data collection. Each participant wrote with a standard black ink pen all 15 numbers in a table with 15 designated regions drawn on a white A4 paper. This process was repeated 10 times with each participant. Each sheet was scanned at the resolution of 300x300 pixels.
It resulted a dataset of 15000 images, each representing one character from a set of 15 characters (grouped in samples, grouped in suites, with 10 samples/volunteer and 100 volunteers).
